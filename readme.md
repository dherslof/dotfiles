# dotfiles

### Description
Repository for keeping track of some of my personal ( @dherslof ) basic dotfiles and well used tools. 

### Contains 
* vimrc
* tmux config
* cargo tools list

### Installation and usage
Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone <github_path>
```

Run the installation script. 
```bash
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

**Note**: running script without arguments will trigger full installation. For available installation options, see the install help.
```bash
./install.sh -h 
```

In alternative to run the above installation script, is to  manually move/link the dotfiles directly from the `files` directory.

### Todos
In the future, it would be nice to add some more features in install script! (Today this needs to be done manually)
